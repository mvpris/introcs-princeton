Function reverse1
The function reverse1 iterates through the string and constructs the reversed string by prepending each character.
Here is the breakdown:

Initialization: int n = s.length(); takes constant time, O(1).
Loop: The for loop runs n times, where n is the length of the string.
String Concatenation: Inside the loop, reverse = s.charAt(i) + reverse; takes O(n) time because string concatenation in
Java creates a new string each time, which involves copying the existing characters.

Therefore, the total time complexity for reverse1 is:
O(1)+O(n)⋅O(n)=O(n2)
Function reverse2
The function reverse2 uses recursion to reverse the string by dividing it into two halves. Here is the breakdown:

Base Case: If the length of the string is 1 or less, it returns the string, which takes constant time, O(1).
Recursive Case: The function splits the string into two halves and recursively reverses each half. The substring method takes O(n) time.

The recurrence relation for the running time T(n) is:
T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n)
Using the Master Theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences, where a=2, b=2, and f(n)=O(n), we get:
T(n)=O(nlogn)
Summary

reverse1: O(n2)
reverse2: O(nlogn)

"How did you arrive at the conclusion that the recurrence relation for the running time T(n) is:
 T(n)=2T(2n​)+O(n) for the second function?"

 Function reverse2
 The function reverse2 works by recursively splitting the string into two halves and then reversing each half. Here’s the function again for reference:
 public static String reverse2(String s) {
     int n = s.length();
     if (n <= 1) return s;
     String left = s.substring(0, n/2);
     String right = s.substring(n/2, n);
     return reverse2(right) + reverse2(left);
 }

 Analysis


 Base Case: If the length of the string n is 1 or less, the function returns the string immediately. This takes constant time, O(1).


 Recursive Case: If the length of the string n is greater than 1, the function performs the following steps:

 Splits the string into two halves: left and right. This involves calling substring, which takes O(n) time.
 Recursively reverses each half: reverse2(right) and reverse2(left).
 Concatenates the results of the two recursive calls, which takes O(n) time.



 Recurrence Relation
 The time complexity T(n) for the function can be expressed as:
 T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n)
 Here’s the reasoning:

 2T(n/2): The function makes two recursive calls, each on a substring of length n/2.
 O(n): The time taken to split the string and concatenate the results.

 Master Theorem
 To solve this recurrence relation, we use the Master Theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form:
 T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n)
 where a=2, b=2, and f(n)=O(n).
 According to the Master Theorem:

 If f(n)=O(nc) where c<log_b(a), then T(n)=O(n^log_b(a)).
 If f(n)=O(nc) where c=log_b(a), then T(n)=O(nclogn).
 If f(n)=O(nc) where c>log_b(a), then T(n)=O(f(n)).

 In our case:

 a=2
 b=2
 log_b(a)=log_2(2)=1
 f(n)=O(n)

 Since f(n)=O(n) and c=1, which is equal to log_b(a), we use the second case of the Master Theorem:
 T(n)=O(nlogn)
